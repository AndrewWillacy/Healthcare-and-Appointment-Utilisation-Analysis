Retail sales analysis using Tableau dashboards and business intelligence reporting
Date: June 2025
Tools Used: Excel, SQL (PostgreSQL), Tableau, PowerPoint

2Market is a (fictional) global supermarket chain operating in eight countries with both physical and online storefronts.
The purpose of this analytics project is to help the business understand:

- Who are their customers (demographics: age, marital status etc)

- Which product categories generate the most revenue

- How demographics influence purchasing patterns

- Which advertising channels are most effective

- How customer behaviour varies by geography

# Data Cleaning & Preparation (Excel)

The raw CSV was imported into Excel and cleaned extensively:

- Standardised formatting, removed duplicates and inconsistencies

- Created calculated fields such as Age and Total_Spend

- Cleaned date formats, removed invalid ages (124+ years)

- Resolved inconsistent/erroneous labels in Marital_Status

- Identified income outliers and adjusted analysis accordingly

- Updated product category names for clarity

- Imported cleaned data into PostgreSQL for analysis

# Database Structure

The project uses two PostgreSQL tables:

Marketing_Data

Includes demographics, purchase details, and customer behaviour metrics such as:
Age, Income, Total_Spend, Education, Marital_Status, Country, Kids/Teens, product category spend, and more.

ad_data

Contains binary indicators showing whether a customer was exposed to each advertising channel:
Twitter, Instagram, Bulkmail, Facebook, Brochure

# Analytical Approach (SQL)

SQL was used to:

- Calculate revenue by country

- Identify top product categories globally and by country

- Analyse purchasing behaviour across demographics

- Evaluate which advertising methods drive the most successful customer responses

- Combine exposure + conversion metrics to determine channel effectiveness

- Segment customers by marital status and presence of children/teens

- Assign customers a simplified Media label for deeper spend comparisons

Example SQL tasks included:

Use of GREATEST() and LEAST() to identify best/worst performing product categories and ad channels

Multi-table joins using (INNER JOIN) to combine demographic and advertising data

GROUPBY to group results such as by marital status or country 

CASE logic for categorising customers

Aggregations to compute spend patterns, averages, and customer counts

# Tableau Dashboard

The Tableau dashboard (included as .twbx) includes:

- Customer age distribution

- Marital status & education breakdowns

- Income distributions

- Geographic map of customer locations & density

- Revenue and product category performance

- Advertising channel effectiveness summaries

The design uses a calm blue palette with clear typography to support executive-level presentations.

# Key Insights
### Customer Demographics

Customer ages range from 28 to 84, average age 55

Majority are married or living with a partner

Most customers have a graduate-level education or higher

### Product Sales

Alcohol is the top-selling category, accounting for 50% of sales

Followed by meat, fish, and commodities

Vegetables and chocolate are the lowest performers

This trend is consistent across most countries

### Geographic Insights

Spain: largest customer base and highest revenue

Germany: highest average spend per customer

Montenegro: extremely low customer count → potential market concern

### Advertising Effectiveness

Twitter is the most successful advertising channel overall

Followed by Instagram and Facebook

Bulk email surprisingly performs well among single customers

Brochure advertising is consistently the least effective

# Recommendations

Increase inventory in high-revenue categories like Alcohol and Meat

Invest more in high-performing ad channels (Twitter, Instagram)

Scale back brochure advertising

Consider targeted bulk email campaigns for specific demographics

Reevaluate investment in underperforming markets like Montenegro

Tailor campaigns using customer segmentation by age, income, and education

# Next Steps

**Customer Segmentation:** Apply clustering techniques to identify distinct customer personas based on demographics and spending behaviour.

**Predictive Modelling:** Build models to predict customer response to advertising campaigns and future spending patterns.

**Advertising Attribution:** Improve ad exposure logic to correctly account for customers exposed to multiple channels.

**Automated Data Pipeline:** Replace manual Excel cleaning with a reproducible Python-based ETL process.

**Enhanced Dashboards:** Add more granualar views for product categories, demographics, and regional performance, including trend and forecast analysis.

**Statistical Validation:** Apply hypothesis testing to validate differences in spend across regions and customer segments.
